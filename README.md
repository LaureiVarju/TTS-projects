# Progress and Projects
[Week 1](https://github.com/LaureiVarju/TTS-projects/tree/master/week_1_projects)  
Sand-box exercises utilizing Bootstrap and JS libraries, as well as practice creating basic JS functions: conversion calculations, if-else loops using user input data, displaying values outside of the console, etc.   

[Week 2](https://github.com/LaureiVarju/TTS-projects/tree/master/week_2_projects)  
More advanced CSS exercises with a focus on Navbar features, Grid, and Flexbox. Also some preliminary work with Intellij and working with .class, .jar, and .java files.   
 
[Pie Chart / Masthead](https://github.com/LaureiVarju/TTS-projects/tree/master/HOMEWORK_Michelle_Dilzell/CSS_Piechar_Navbar)      
A TTS assignment to build a responsive piechart and masthead using CSS & HTML   

[Week 3](https://github.com/LaureiVarju/TTS-projects/tree/master/week_3_projects)   
Continued exercises in Javascript with a focus on manipulating and accessing data in arrays. Most of my time was spent generating arrays that reported the Fibonacci sequence using an iterative solution with 2 pre-defined values. OOP concepts and computer architecture was also discussed as well as Agile workflows.   

[Week 4](https://github.com/LaureiVarju/TTS-projects/tree/master/week_4_projects)   
Began learning basic Github and VCS concepts, front-end debugging tools, control flow concepts, DOM manipulation, and more features of popular JS libraries.

[JS Libraries](https://github.com/LaureiVarju/TTS-projects/blob/master/HOMEWORK_Michelle_Dilzell/JS_Libraries_HW.zip)    
A TTS assignment with exercises solving problems by utilizing functions within the following JS libraries - jQuery, Lodash, Moment, Math, DataTable and Chart   

[To-Do List](https://github.com/LaureiVarju/TTS-projects/blob/master/HOMEWORK_Michelle_Dilzell/To%20Do%20List%20HW.zip)    
A TTS assignment with an interactive To-Do list using Javascript and JQuery
 
[Week 5 - Angular Projects](https://github.com/LaureiVarju/TTS-projects/tree/master/HOMEWORK_Michelle_Dilzell/Angular%20HW%202%20-%20Services%20and%20DI)   
The majority of this week has been spent on updating Github pages and refining and building upon an Angular project that includes basic routing, dependency injection, interactive forms, and animations. Some Java instruction has also begun.

[Weeks 6 and 7](https://github.com/LaureiVarju/TTS-projects/tree/master/week_7_projects)   
Continued work on Java concepts. Reviewed Control Flow, Lambdas and Streams, Linked Lists, Array Lists and Hashmaps. Created multiple versions of a dice game simulating craps. Some versions used else/if statements and do-while loops, others used enums and collections to check for win/lose/point conditions.

[Weeks 8 and 9]](https://github.com/LaureiVarju/TTS-projects/tree/master/week_8_and_9_projects)
Java assessment (Binary Trees, Big O Notation, and previous weeks topics).
Spring, Hibernate and Spring Boot introductions, Design Patterns (Singleton, Factory Method, etc).
SQL and relational databases, some RESTful API lectures, and work on a front-end project trying to match the splash page of a major enterprise website.

[Front End Project](https://github.com/LaureiVarju/TTS-projects/tree/master/week_8_and_9_projects/wordpress_splash_page)
An attempt to recreate the front splash page of Wordpress.com to spec. visually.
