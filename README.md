# Progress and Projects
[Week 1](https://github.com/LaureiVarju/TTS-projects/tree/master/week_1_projects)  
Sand-box exercises utilizing Bootstrap and JS libraries, as well as practice creating basic JS functions (conversion calculations, if-else loops using user input data, displaying values outside of the console, etc).   

[Week 2](https://github.com/LaureiVarju/TTS-projects/tree/master/week_2_projects)  
More advanced CSS exercises with a focus on Grid and Flexbox   
[Pie Chart / Masthead](https://github.com/LaureiVarju/TTS-projects/tree/master/HOMEWORK_Michelle_Dilzell/CSS_Piechar_Navbar)      
A TTS assignment to build a piechart and masthead to spec using only CSS & HTML   
[Week 3](https://github.com/LaureiVarju/TTS-projects/tree/master/week_3_projects)   
Continued exercises in Javascript with a focus on manipulating and accessing data in arrays. Most of my time was spent generating arrays that reported the Fibonacci sequence using an iterative solution using 2 pre-defined values to generate from and recursive solution.   

[Week 4](https://github.com/LaureiVarju/TTS-projects/tree/master/week_4_projects)
