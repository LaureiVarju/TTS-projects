# Progress and Projects
[Week 1](https://github.com/LaureiVarju/TTS-projects/tree/master/week_1_projects)  
Sand-box exercises utilizing Bootstrap and JS libraries, as well as practice creating basic JS functions (conversion calculations, if-else loops using user input data, displaying values outside of the console, etc).   

[Week 2](https://github.com/LaureiVarju/TTS-projects/tree/master/week_2_projects)  
More advanced CSS exercises with a focus on Navbar features, Grid, and Flexbox. Also some preliminary work with Intellij and working with .class and .jar and .java files.

[Week 3](https://github.com/LaureiVarju/TTS-projects/tree/master/week_3_projects)   
Continued exercises in Javascript with a focus on manipulating and accessing data in arrays. Most of my time was spent generating arrays that reported the Fibonacci sequence using an iterative solution with 2 pre-defined values to generate from and recursive solution. OOP concepts in the context of procedural programming and computer architecture was also discussed as well as Agile workflows.   

[Week 4](https://github.com/LaureiVarju/TTS-projects/tree/master/week_4_projects)   
Focus on basic Github concepts, front-end debugging, control flow, DOM manipulation, and more features of popular JS libraries.

A TTS assignment with exercises solving problems by utilizing functions within the following JS libraries - jQuery, Lodash, Moment, Math, DataTable and Chart   

[To-Do List](https://github.com/LaureiVarju/TTS-projects/blob/master/HOMEWORK_Michelle_Dilzell/To%20Do%20List%20HW.zip)
