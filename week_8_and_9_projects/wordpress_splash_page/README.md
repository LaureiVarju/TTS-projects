When I first looked at this assignment, I noticed we were encouraged to use bootstrap (we spent a great deal of time becoming familiar with bootstrap).

While I studied the source code for these sites, however, bootstrap didn't seem to be in use...so I decided to see what I could pull off without features like grid.

The answer? Quite a lot, with lots and lots and lots of cross-referencing, cookies, flex displays, W3 Schools look-ups, more cookies, and systematically (and accidentally) breaking large sections of code :)


While I was able to retain a decent portion of the site's original look, this was an extremely slow and methodical approach and I wouldn't do it again with the time-frame I had available to me.

Some things I learned along the way:
--------------------------------------------

1. SMACSS naming conventions and the theory behind them

2. Some familiarity studying CSS that was probably generated with a SASS compiler and cross-referencing relationships that appeared in 30 or more places at times
(doing this manually with upwards of 8000 lines of code ate up the majority of my time with this project)

3. Pseudo-classes and their use-cases

4. Media queries

Limitations:
--------------------------------------------
Obviously I didn't get very far past the Navigation Bar and the first major section of the site, with limited responsiveness beyond a Chrome browser and a medium-sized display...however, I'm pleased with how closely the section I did mimic seems to be to spec visually.
