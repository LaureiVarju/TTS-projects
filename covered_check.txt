Day 4
(see written notes)
Java script data type and how data conversion gets interpreted
Variables (let and const not covered in this)
Functions
HTML Functions
( JavaScript has built-in functions that let us modify HTML & CSS.)
Conditionals (if, else, etc)
Linking to jquery ( a library)
iterations
more specific examples.. not sure which to prioritize
    statements:
           (if, else, switch.) Looping/iteration/cycling related: (while, break, continue)

Loose typing = allows a variable to be changed
Coersion = JS automatically forcing a variable into something that makes sense.
Explicit coersion = ie. taking a string off a databse from people's input and forcing it into a number.

built in conversion functions:
ParseInt <-- parses a string argument and returns an integer of the specified radix (the base in mathematical numeral systems).
parseFloat() <-- parses an argument and returns a floating point number.
toString() <-- whatever to string
-------------------
Day 5 - more higher concepts, what is object orientation

OOP languages
"oo" "A "PIE" (object oriented - Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance, Encapsulation)

 JIRA

---------------------
Day 6
-------------------
<section> and id tags
"Hero" image -- banner image

CSS terms:
viewport 1vw = 1% of viewport width
flex containers

stacks: pre-installed software on a server to make management simpler( isolated to servers? unsure.

Most common stack is a LAMP
Linuix, Apache, MySQL, PHP
Linuix - server OS 
Apache - software that sorts and filters file requests, sometimes NGINX is used (faster)
MySQL - database
PHP - server-side programming language 
****

git notes:
I currently have a repository on github tracking my TTS Projects folder:

navigate to my folder:
C:\Users\User\Documents\TTS Projects

Have to use "" around TTS Projects because of the space.

git status

git add -A to add all files in the root of the folder. That should stage them all

then git commit? -m "message"?

Day 7 Bootstrap topics
Everything in bootstrap displays dynamically across different devices

Bootstrap is best known for its grid system

<tr> table row
<td> cell of data

It's a library of pre-made CSS classes with built in responsiveness across displays. Saves time.

when linking locally, use:
/bootstrap.min.css and jquery-3.3.1.min.js

Containers and fluid containers:
<header class="page-header header container-fluid">

</header>

The fluid part makes sure the container stretches across the entire width of the screen. Thereâ€™s also just container, which has fixed widths applied to it, so there will always be space on both sides of the screen
