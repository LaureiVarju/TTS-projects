Day 4
(see written notes)
Java script data type and how data conversion gets interpreted
Variables (let and const not covered in this)
Functions
HTML Functions
( JavaScript has built-in functions that let us modify HTML & CSS.)
Conditionals (if, else, etc)
Linking to jquery ( a library)
iterations
more specific examples.. not sure which to prioritize
    statements:
           (if, else, switch.) Looping/iteration/cycling related: (while, break, continue)

Loose typing = allows a variable to be changed
Coersion = JS automatically forcing a variable into something that makes sense.
Explicit coersion = ie. taking a string off a databse from people's input and forcing it into a number.

built in conversion functions:
ParseInt <-- parses a string argument and returns an integer of the specified radix (the base in mathematical numeral systems).
parseFloat() <-- parses an argument and returns a floating point number.
toString() <-- whatever to string

Looping/Iterations
