    <h1>Fibonacci Javascript Exercise A</h1>
    <p>
      The goal of this code is to pull a specific value from an array that
      generates the Fibonacci sequence.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once you input a value in the prompt, the console will display the
      Fibonacchi number that occurs in the sequence equivalent to the input
      value.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example: the first five numbers that occur in the Fibonacci sequence
      are: 0, 1, 1, 2 and 3.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you input '5' into the prompt, the value returned in the console will
      be 3, because 3 is the fifth number in the Fibonacci sequence.
    </p>

    <form>
      <label for="inputValueA">
        Write the sequence number of the Fibonacchi value you would like to
        check
      </label>
      <input id="inputValueA" />
    </form>

    <br />
    <button id="buttonA">Check the Fibonacci sequence!</button>

    <p>The result is:</p>
    <p id="output"></p>
