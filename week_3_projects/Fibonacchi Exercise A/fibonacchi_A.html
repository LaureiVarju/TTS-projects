    <h1>Fibonacci Javascript Exercise A</h1>
    <p>
      The goal of this code is to pull an indexed value from a generated array
      that calculates the Fibonacci sequence.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once you input a value in the prompt, the console will display an output
      value. The output value is equivalent to the fibonacchi number that occurs
      in the sequence at the input value.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example: the first five numbers that occur in the sequence are: 0, 1,
      1, 2 and 3.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you input '5' into the prompt, the value returned in the console will
      be 3, because 3 is the fifth number in the sequence.
